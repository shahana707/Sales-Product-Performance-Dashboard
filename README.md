# Sales-Product-Performance-Dashboard
Data GUC | Jun 2025

Developed an end-to-end Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance and product contribution for an FMCG company across February and March 2025.

Cleaned and unpivoted fragmented raw data using Power Query, enabling accurate month-wise and product-level comparisons.

Visualized KPIs such as Total Sales vs. Target, Target Achievement %, MoM Growth, Sales Variance, and Top/Bottom Performers.

Uncovered a 30% drop in sales vs. target and identified salesperson-specific performance gaps to support better coaching and resource decisions.

Strengthened skills in DAX, data modeling, and business storytelling to drive visibility and performance improvement.
